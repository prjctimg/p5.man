`describe()`                                          |p5-accessibility-describe|

*   Creates a screen reader accessible description for
  the canvas. The first parameter should be a string
  with a description of the canvas. The second
  parameter is optional. If specified, it determines
  how the description is displayed. describe(text,
  LABEL) displays the description to all users as a
  tombstone or exhibit label/caption in a div
  adjacent to the canvas. You can style it as you
  wish in your CSS.
         *   describe(text, FALLBACK) makes the description
  accessible to screen-reader users only, in  a sub
  DOM inside the canvas element. If a second
  parameter is not specified, by default, the
  description will only be available to
  screen-reader users.
  - **text**: description of the canvas
  @param [display] either LABEL or FALLBACK

`describeElement()`                                          |p5-accessibility-describeElement|

*   This function creates a screen-reader accessible
  description for elements —shapes or groups of
  shapes that create meaning together— in the
  canvas. The first paramater should be the name of
  the element. The second parameter should be a
  string with a description of the element. The
  third parameter is optional. If specified, it
  determines how the element description is
  displayed. describeElement(name, text, LABEL)
  displays the element description to all users as a
  tombstone or exhibit label/caption in a div
  adjacent to the canvas. You can style it as you
  wish in your CSS.
         *   describeElement(name, text, FALLBACK) makes the
  element description accessible to screen-reader
  users only, in  a sub DOM inside the canvas
  element. If a second parameter is not specified,
  by default, the element description will only be
  available to screen-reader users.
  - **name**: name of the element
  - **text**: description of the element
  @param [display] either LABEL or FALLBACK

`textOutput()`                                          |p5-accessibility-textOutput|

*   textOutput() creates a screenreader accessible
  output that describes the shapes present on the
  canvas. The general description of the canvas
  includes canvas size, canvas color, and number of
  elements in the canvas (example: 'Your output is
  a, 400 by 400 pixels, lavender blue canvas
  containing the following 4 shapes:'). This
  description is followed by a list of shapes where
  the color, position, and area of each shape are
  described (example: "orange ellipse at top left
  covering 1% of the canvas"). Each element can be
  selected to get more details. A table of elements
  is also provided. In this table, shape, color,
  location, coordinates and area are described
  (example: "orange ellipse location=top left
  area=2"). textOutput() and textOutput(FALLBACK)
  make the output available in  a sub DOM inside the
  canvas element which is accessible to screen
  readers. textOutput(LABEL) creates an additional
  div with the output adjacent to the canvas, this
  is useful for non-screen reader users that might
  want to display the output outside of the canvas'
  sub DOM as they code. However, using LABEL will
  create unnecessary redundancy for screen reader
  users. We recommend using LABEL only as part of
  the development process of a sketch and removing
  it before publishing or sharing with screen reader
  users.
  @param [display] either FALLBACK or LABEL

`gridOutput()`                                          |p5-accessibility-gridOutput|

*   gridOutput() lays out the content of the canvas in
  the form of a grid (html table) based on the
  spatial location of each shape. A brief
  description of the canvas is available before the
  table output. This description includes: color of
  the background, size of the canvas, number of
  objects, and object types (example: "lavender blue
  canvas is 200 by 200 and contains 4 objects - 3
  ellipses 1 rectangle"). The grid describes the
  content spatially, each element is placed on a
  cell of the table depending on its position.
  Within each cell an element the color and type of
  shape of that element are available (example:
  "orange ellipse"). These descriptions can be
  selected individually to get more details. A list
  of elements where shape, color, location, and area
  are described (example: "orange ellipse
  location=top left area=1%") is also available.
  gridOutput() and gridOutput(FALLBACK) make the
  output available in  a sub DOM inside the canvas
  element which is accessible to screen readers.
  gridOutput(LABEL) creates an additional div with
  the output adjacent to the canvas, this is useful
  for non-screen reader users that might want to
  display the output outside of the canvas' sub DOM
  as they code. However, using LABEL will create
  unnecessary redundancy for screen reader users. We
  recommend using LABEL only as part of the
  development process of a sketch and removing it
  before publishing or sharing with screen reader
  users.
  @param [display] either FALLBACK or LABEL
