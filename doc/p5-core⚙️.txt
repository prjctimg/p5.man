## Functions

### print

*   The print() function writes to the console area of
  your browser. This function is often helpful for
  looking at the data a program is producing. This
  function creates a new line of text for each call
  to the function. Individual elements can be
  separated with quotes ("") and joined with the
  addition operator (+). Note that calling print()
  without any arguments invokes the window.print()
  function which opens the browser's print dialog.
  To print a blank line to console you can write
  print('\n').
  - **contents**: any combination of Number, String,
  Object, Boolean, Array to print

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### images

*   Sets the cursor to a predefined symbol or an
  image, or makes it visible if already hidden. If
  you are trying to set an image as the cursor, the
  recommended size is 16×16 or 32×32 pixels. The
  values for parameters x and y must be less than
  the dimensions of the image.
  - **type**: Built-In: either ARROW, CROSS, HAND,
  MOVE, TEXT and WAIT Native CSS properties: 'grab',
  'progress', 'cell' etc. External: path for
  cursor's images (Allowed File extensions: .cur,
  .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .png) For more information on
  Native CSS cursors and url visit:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor
  @param [x] the horizontal active spot of the
  cursor (must be less than 32)
  @param [y] the vertical active spot of the cursor
  (must be less than 32)

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### frameRate

*   Specifies the number of frames to be displayed
  every second. For example, the function call
  frameRate(30) will attempt to refresh 30 times a
  second. If the processor is not fast enough to
  maintain the specified rate, the frame rate will
  not be achieved. Setting the frame rate within
  setup() is recommended. The default frame rate is
  based on the frame rate of the display (here also
  called "refresh rate"), which is set to 60 frames
  per second on most computers. A frame rate of 24
  frames per second (usual for movies) or above will
  be enough for smooth animations. This is the same
  as setFrameRate(val). Calling frameRate() with no
  arguments returns the current framerate. The draw
  function must run at least once before it will
  return a value. This is the same as
  getFrameRate().
         *   Calling frameRate() with arguments that are not of
  the type Number or are non-positive also returns
  current framerate.
  - **fps**: number of frames to be displayed every
  second

  - **Returns**: current frameRate

*Sub-module: environment*

### frameRate

*   Returns _targetFrameRate variable. The default
  _targetFrameRate is set to 60. This could be
  changed by calling frameRate() and setting it to
  the desired value. When getTargetFrameRate() is
  called, it should return the value that was set.
  - **Returns**: _targetFrameRate

*Sub-module: environment*

### noCursor

*   Hides the cursor from view.

*Sub-module: environment*

### windowResized

*   The windowResized() function is called once every
  time the browser window is resized. This is a good
  place to resize the canvas or do any other
  adjustments to accommodate the new window size.
  @param [event] optional Event callback argument.

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### fullscreen

*   If argument is given, sets the sketch to
  fullscreen or not based on the value of the
  argument. If no argument is given, returns the
  current fullscreen state. Note that due to browser
  restrictions this can only be called on user
  input, for example, on mouse press like the
  example below.
  @param [val] whether the sketch should be in
  fullscreen mode or not
  - **Returns**: current fullscreen state

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### pixelDensity

*   Sets the pixel scaling for high pixel density
  displays. By default pixel density is set to match
  display density, call pixelDensity(1) to turn this
  off. Calling pixelDensity() with no arguments
  returns the current pixel density of the sketch.
  - **val**: whether or how much the sketch should
  scale

### pixelDensity

*   Sets the pixel scaling for high pixel density
  displays. By default pixel density is set to match
  display density, call pixelDensity(1) to turn this
  off. Calling pixelDensity() with no arguments
  returns the current pixel density of the sketch.
  - **Returns**: current pixel density of the sketch

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### displayDensity

*   Returns the pixel density of the current display
  the sketch is running on.
  - **Returns**: current pixel density of the display

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### getURL

*   Gets the current URL. Note: when using the p5
  Editor, this will return an empty object because
  the sketch is embedded in an iframe. It will work
  correctly if you view the sketch using the
  editor's present or share URLs.
  - **Returns**: url

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### getURLPath

*   Gets the current URL path as an array. Note: when
  using the p5 Editor, this will return an empty
  object because the sketch is embedded in an
  iframe. It will work correctly if you view the
  sketch using the editor's present or share URLs.
  - **Returns**: path components

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### getURLParams

*   Gets the current URL params as an Object. Note:
  when using the p5 Editor, this will return an
  empty object because the sketch is embedded in an
  iframe. It will work correctly if you view the
  sketch using the editor's present or share URLs.
  - **Returns**: URL params

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### setup

*   Creates a canvas element in the document and sets
  its dimensions in pixels. This method should be
  called only once at the start of setup(). Calling
  createCanvas more than once in a sketch will
  result in very unpredictable behavior. If you want
  more than one drawing canvas you could use
  createGraphics() (hidden by default but it can be
  shown). Important note: in 2D mode (i.e. when
  p5.Renderer is not set) the origin (0,0) is
  positioned at the top left of the screen. In 3D
  mode (i.e. when p5.Renderer is set to WEBGL), the
  origin is positioned at the center of the canvas.
  See this issue for more information.
         *   A WebGL canvas will use a WebGL2 context if it is
  supported by the browser. Check the webglVersion
  property to check what version is being used, or
  call setAttributes({ version: 1 }) to create a
  WebGL1 context.
         *   The system variables width and height are set by
  the parameters passed to this function. If
  createCanvas() is not used, the window will be
  given a default size of 100×100 pixels.
         *   Optionally, an existing canvas can be passed using
  a selector, ie. document.getElementById(''). If
  specified, avoid using setAttributes() afterwards,
  as this will remove and recreate the existing
  canvas.
         *   For more ways to position the canvas, see the
  positioning the canvas wiki page.
  - **w**: width of the canvas
  - **h**: height of the canvas
  @param [renderer] either P2D or WEBGL
  @param [canvas] existing html canvas element
  - **Returns**: pointer to p5.Renderer holding canvas

  - **w**: width of the canvas
  - **h**: height of the canvas
  @param [canvas] existing html canvas element
  - **Returns**: pointer to p5.Renderer holding canvas

*Sub-module: rendering*

---

### resizeCanvas

*   Resizes the canvas to given width and height. The
  canvas will be cleared and draw will be called
  immediately, allowing the sketch to re-render
  itself in the resized canvas.
  - **w**: width of the canvas
  - **h**: height of the canvas
  @param [noRedraw] don't redraw the canvas
  immediately

*Sub-module: rendering*

---

### noCanvas

*   Removes the default canvas for a p5 sketch that
  doesn't require a canvas

*Sub-module: rendering*

---

### setAttributes

*   Creates and returns a new p5.Graphics object. Use
  this class if you need to draw into an off-screen
  graphics buffer. The two parameters define the
  width and height in pixels. A WebGL p5.Graphics
  will use a WebGL2 context if it is supported by
  the browser. Check the pg.webglVersion property of
  the renderer to check what version is being used,
  or call pg.setAttributes({ version: 1 }) to create
  a WebGL1 context.
         *   Optionally, an existing canvas can be passed using
  a selector, ie. document.getElementById(''). By
  default this canvas will be hidden (offscreen
  buffer), to make visible, set element's style to
  display:block;
  - **w**: width of the offscreen graphics buffer
  - **h**: height of the offscreen graphics buffer
  @param [renderer] either P2D or WEBGL undefined
  defaults to p2d
  @param [canvas] existing html canvas element
  - **Returns**: offscreen graphics buffer

*Sub-module: rendering*

  - **w**: width of the offscreen graphics buffer
  - **h**: height of the offscreen graphics buffer
  @param [canvas] existing html canvas element
  - **Returns**: offscreen graphics buffer

*Sub-module: rendering*

---

### canvas

*   Creates and returns a new p5.Framebuffer, a
  high-performance WebGL object that you can draw to
  and then use as a texture. Options can include:
         *   - format: The data format of the texture, either
  UNSIGNED_BYTE, FLOAT, or HALF_FLOAT. The default
  is UNSIGNED_BYTE.
  - channels: What color channels to store, either
  RGB or RGBA. The default is to match the channels
  in the main canvas (with alpha unless disabled
  with setAttributes.)
  - depth: A boolean, whether or not to include a
  depth buffer. Defaults to true.
  - depthFormat: The data format for depth
  information, either UNSIGNED_INT or FLOAT. The
  default is FLOAT if available, or UNSIGNED_INT
  otherwise.
  - antialias: Boolean or Number, whether or not to
  render with antialiased edges, and if so,
  optionally the number of samples to use. Defaults
  to whether or not the main canvas is antialiased,
  using a default of 2 samples if so. Antialiasing
  is only supported when WebGL 2 is available.
  - width: The width of the texture. Defaults to
  matching the main canvas.
  - height: The height of the texture. Defaults to
  matching the main canvas.
  - density: The pixel density of the texture.
  Defaults to the pixel density of the main canvas.
  - textureFiltering: Either LINEAR (nearby pixels
  will be interpolated when reading values from the
  color texture) or NEAREST (no interpolation.)
  Generally, use LINEAR when using the texture as an
  image, and use NEAREST if reading the texture as
  data. Defaults to LINEAR.
         *   If width, height, or density are specified, then
  the framebuffer will keep that size until manually
  changed. Otherwise, it will be autosized, and it
  will update to match the main canvas's size and
  density when the main canvas changes.
  @param [options] An optional object with
  configuration

*Sub-module: rendering*

---

### pixels

*   Blends the pixels in the display window according
  to the defined mode. There is a choice of the
  following modes to blend the source pixels (A)
  with the ones of pixels already in the display
  window (B): - BLEND - linear interpolation of
  colours: C = A*factor + B. This is the default
  blending mode.
  - ADD - sum of A and B
  - DARKEST - only the darkest colour succeeds: C =
  min(A*factor, B).
  - LIGHTEST - only the lightest colour succeeds: C
  = max(A*factor, B).
  - DIFFERENCE - subtract colors from underlying
  image. (2D)
  - EXCLUSION - similar to DIFFERENCE, but less
  extreme.
  - MULTIPLY - multiply the colors, result will
  always be darker.
  - SCREEN - opposite multiply, uses inverse values
  of the colors.
  - REPLACE - the pixels entirely replace the others
  and don't utilize alpha (transparency) values.
  - REMOVE - removes pixels from B with the alpha
  strength of A.
  - OVERLAY - mix of MULTIPLY and SCREEN .
  Multiplies dark values, and screens light values.
  (2D)
  - HARD_LIGHT - SCREEN when greater than 50% gray,
  MULTIPLY when lower. (2D)
  - SOFT_LIGHT - mix of DARKEST and LIGHTEST. Works
  like OVERLAY, but not as harsh. (2D)
  - DODGE - lightens light tones and increases
  contrast, ignores darks. (2D)
  - BURN - darker areas are applied, increasing
  contrast, ignores lights. (2D)
  - SUBTRACT - remainder of A and B (3D)
         *   (2D) indicates that this blend mode only works in
  the 2D renderer.
         *   (3D) indicates that this blend mode only works in
  the WEBGL renderer.
  - **mode**: blend mode to set for canvas. either
  BLEND, DARKEST, LIGHTEST, DIFFERENCE, MULTIPLY,
  EXCLUSION, SCREEN, REPLACE, OVERLAY, HARD_LIGHT,
  SOFT_LIGHT, DODGE, BURN, ADD, REMOVE or SUBTRACT

### draw

*   Stops p5.js from continuously executing the code
  within draw(). If loop() is called, the code in
  draw() begins to run continuously again. If using
  noLoop() in setup(), it should be the last line
  inside the block. When noLoop() is used, it's not
  possible to manipulate or access the screen inside
  event handling functions such as mousePressed() or
  keyPressed(). Instead, use those functions to call
  redraw() or loop(), which will run draw(), which
  can update the screen properly. This means that
  when noLoop() has been called, no drawing can
  happen, and functions like saveFrames() or
  loadPixels() may not be used.
         *   Note that if the sketch is resized, redraw() will
  be called to update the sketch, even after
  noLoop() has been specified. Otherwise, the sketch
  would enter an odd state until loop() was called.
         *   Use isLooping() to check the current state of
  loop().

*Sub-module: structure*

---

### draw

*   By default, p5.js loops through draw()
  continuously, executing the code within it.
  However, the draw() loop may be stopped by calling
  noLoop(). In that case, the draw() loop can be
  resumed with loop(). Avoid calling loop() from
  inside setup().
         *   Use isLooping() to check the current state of
  loop().

*Sub-module: structure*

---

### draw

*   By default, p5.js loops through draw()
  continuously, executing the code within it. If the
  sketch is stopped with noLoop() or resumed with
  loop(), isLooping() returns the current state for
  use within custom event handlers.

*Sub-module: structure*

---

### push

*   The push() function saves the current drawing
  style settings and transformations, while pop()
  restores these settings. Note that these functions
  are always used together. They allow you to change
  the style and transformation settings and later
  return to what you had. When a new state is
  started with push(), it builds on the current
  style and transform information. The push() and
  pop() functions can be embedded to provide more
  control. (See the second example for a
  demonstration.) push() stores information related
  to the current transformation state and style
  settings controlled by the following functions:
  fill(), noFill(), noStroke(), stroke(), tint(),
  noTint(), strokeWeight(), strokeCap(),
  strokeJoin(), imageMode(), rectMode(),
  ellipseMode(), colorMode(), textAlign(),
  textFont(), textSize(), textLeading(),
  applyMatrix(), resetMatrix(), rotate(), scale(),
  shearX(), shearY(), translate(), noiseSeed().
         *   In WEBGL mode additional style settings are
  stored. These are controlled by the following
  functions: setCamera(), ambientLight(),
  directionalLight(), pointLight(), texture(),
  specularMaterial(), shininess(), normalMaterial()
  and shader().

### draw

*   Executes the code within draw() one time. This
  function allows the program to update the display
  window only when necessary, for example when an
  event registered by mousePressed() or keyPressed()
  occurs. In structuring a program, it only makes
  sense to call redraw() within events such as
  mousePressed(). This is because redraw() does not
  run draw() immediately (it only sets a flag that
  indicates an update is needed).
         *   The redraw() function does not work properly when
  called inside draw().To enable/disable animations,
  use loop() and noLoop().
         *   In addition you can set the number of redraws per
  method call. Just add an integer as single
  parameter for the number of redraws.
  @param [n] Redraw for n-times. The default value
  is 1.

*Sub-module: structure*

---

### p5

*   The p5() constructor enables you to activate
  "instance mode" instead of normal "global mode".
  This is an advanced topic. A short description and
  example is included below. Please see  Dan
  Shiffman's Coding Train video tutorial or this
  tutorial page for more info. By default, all p5.js
  functions are in the global namespace (i.e. bound
  to the window object), meaning you can call them
  simply ellipse(), fill(), etc. However, this might
  be inconvenient if you are mixing with other JS
  libraries (synchronously or asynchronously) or
  writing long programs of your own. p5.js currently
  supports a way around this problem called
  "instance mode". In instance mode, all p5
  functions are bound up in a single variable
  instead of polluting your global namespace.
         *   Optionally, you can specify a default container
  for the canvas and any other elements to append to
  with a second argument. You can give the ID of an
  element in your html, or an html node itself.
         *   Note that creating instances like this also allows
  you to have more than one p5 sketch on a single
  web page, as they will each be wrapped up with
  their own set up variables. Of course, you could
  also use iframes to have multiple sketches in
  global mode.
  - **sketch**: a function containing a p5.js sketch
  - **node**: ID or pointer to HTML DOM node to
  contain sketch in

### length

*   Multiplies the current matrix by the one specified
  through the parameters. This is a powerful
  operation that can perform the equivalent of
  translate, scale, shear and rotate all at once.
  You can learn more about transformation matrices
  on  Wikipedia. The naming of the arguments here
  follows the naming of the  WHATWG specification
  and corresponds to a transformation matrix of the
  form:
  - **arr**: an array of numbers - should be 6 or 16
  length (2×3 or 4×4 matrix values)

  matrix.

### rotate

*   Rotates a shape by the amount specified by the
  angle parameter. This function accounts for
  angleMode, so angles can be entered in either
  RADIANS or DEGREES. Objects are always rotated
  around their relative position to the origin and
  positive numbers rotate objects in a clockwise
  direction. Transformations apply to everything
  that happens after and subsequent calls to the
  function accumulate the effect. For example,
  calling rotate(HALF_PI) and then rotate(HALF_PI)
  is the same as rotate(PI). All transformations are

### draw

*   Rotates a shape around X axis by the amount
  specified in angle parameter. The angles can be
  entered in either RADIANS or DEGREES. Objects are
  always rotated around their relative position to
  the origin and positive numbers rotate objects in
  a clockwise direction. All transformations are
  reset when draw() begins again.

### scale

*   Increases or decreases the size of a shape by
  expanding or contracting vertices. Objects always
  scale from their relative origin to the coordinate
  system. Scale values are specified as decimal
  percentages. For example, the function call
  scale(2.0) increases the dimension of a shape by
  200%. Transformations apply to everything that
  happens after and subsequent calls to the function
  multiply the effect. For example, calling
  scale(2.0) and then scale(1.5) is the same as
  scale(3.0). If scale() is called within draw(),
  the transformation is reset when the loop begins
  again.
         *   Using this function with the z parameter is only
  available in WEBGL mode. This function can be
  further controlled with push() and pop().
  - **s**: percent to scale the object, or
  percentage to scale the object in the x-axis if
  multiple arguments are given
  @param [y] percent to scale the object in the
  y-axis

### shearX

*   Shears a shape around the x-axis by the amount
  specified by the angle parameter. Angles should be
  specified in the current angleMode. Objects are
  always sheared around their relative position to
  the origin and positive numbers shear objects in a
  clockwise direction. Transformations apply to
  everything that happens after and subsequent calls
  to the function accumulates the effect. For
  example, calling shearX(PI/2) and then
  shearX(PI/2) is the same as shearX(PI). If
  shearX() is called within the draw(), the
  transformation is reset when the loop begins
  again.
         *   Technically, shearX() multiplies the current
  transformation matrix by a rotation matrix. This
  function can be further controlled by the push()

### translate

*   Specifies an amount to displace objects within the
  display window. The x parameter specifies
  left/right translation, the y parameter specifies
  up/down translation. Transformations are
  cumulative and apply to everything that happens
  after and subsequent calls to the function
  accumulates the effect. For example, calling
  translate(50, 0) and then translate(20, 0) is the
  same as translate(70, 0). If translate() is called
  within draw(), the transformation is reset when
  the loop begins again. This function can be
  further controlled by using push() and pop().
  - **x**: left/right translation
  - **y**: up/down translation
  @param [z] forward/backward translation (WEBGL
  only)

### createCanvas

*   Base class for all elements added to a sketch,
  including canvas, graphics buffers, and other HTML
  elements. It is not called directly, but
  p5.Element objects are created by calling
  createCanvas(), createGraphics(), createDiv(),
  createImg(), createInput(), etc.
         *   - **elt**: DOM node that is wrapped
  @param [pInst] pointer to p5 instance

*Sub-module: p5.Element*

---

### parent

*   Attaches the element to the parent specified. A
  way of setting the container for the element.
  Accepts either a string ID, DOM node, or
  p5.Element. If no arguments are given, parent node
  is returned. For more ways to position the canvas,
  see the  positioning the canvas wiki page.

*Sub-module: p5.Element*

---

### class

*   Sets the ID of the element. If no ID argument is
  passed in, it instead returns the current ID of
  the element. Note that only one element can have a
  particular id in a page. The class() method can be
  used to identify multiple elements with the same
  class name.

### constructor

*   Thin wrapper around a renderer, to be used for
  creating a graphics buffer object. Use this class
  if you need to draw into an off-screen graphics
  buffer. The two parameters define the width and
  height in pixels. The fields and methods for this
  class are extensive, but mirror the normal drawing
  API for p5.
         *   - **w**: width
  - **h**: height
  - **renderer**: the renderer to use, either P2D or
  WEBGL
  @param [pInst] pointer to p5 instance
  @param [canvas] existing html canvas element

*Sub-module: p5.Graphics*

  any resources associated with it.

*Sub-module: p5.Graphics*

---

### createFramebuffer

*   Creates and returns a new p5.Framebuffer inside a
  p5.Graphics WebGL context. This takes the same
  parameters as the global createFramebuffer
  function.

*Sub-module: p5.Graphics*

---

### constructor

*   Main graphics and rendering context, as well as
  the base API implementation for p5.js "core". To
  be used as the superclass for Renderer2D and
  Renderer3D classes, respectively.
         *   - **elt**: DOM node that is wrapped
  @param [pInst] pointer to p5 instance
  @param [isMainCanvas] whether we're using it as
  main canvas

*Sub-module: p5.Renderer*

---

### setup

*   The setup() function is called once when the
  program starts. It's used to define initial
  environment properties such as screen size and
  background color and to load media such as images
  and fonts as the program starts. There can only be
  one setup() function for each program and it
  shouldn't be called again after its initial
  execution. Note: Variables declared within setup()
  are not accessible within other functions,
  including draw().

*Sub-module: p5.Renderer*

---

### setup

*   Called directly after setup(), the draw() function
  continuously executes the lines of code contained
  inside its block until the program is stopped or
  noLoop() is called. Note if noLoop() is called in
  setup(), draw() will still be executed once before
  stopping. draw() is called automatically and
  should never be called explicitly. It should
  always be controlled with noLoop(), redraw() and
  loop(). After noLoop() stops the code in draw()
  from executing, redraw() causes the code inside
  draw() to execute once, and loop() will cause the
  code inside draw() to resume executing
  continuously.
     *   The number of times draw() executes in each second
  may be controlled with the frameRate() function.
     *   There can only be one draw() function for each
  sketch, and draw() must exist if you want the code
  to run continuously, or to process events such as
  mousePressed(). Sometimes, you might have an empty
  call to draw() in your program, as shown in the
  above example.
     *   It is important to note that the drawing
  coordinate system will be reset at the beginning
  of each draw() call. If any transformations are
  performed within draw() (ex: scale, rotate,
  translate), their effects will be undone at the
  beginning of draw(), so transformations will not
  accumulate over time. On the other hand, styling
  applied (ex: fill, stroke, etc) will remain in
  effect.

*Sub-module: p5.Renderer*

---

### remove

*   Removes the entire p5 sketch. This will remove the
  canvas and any elements created by p5.js. It will
  also stop the draw loop and unbind any properties
  or methods from the window global scope. It will
  leave a variable p5 in case you wanted to create a
  new p5 sketch. If you like, you can set p5 = null
  to erase it. While all functions and variables and
  objects created by the p5 library will be removed,
  any other global variables created by your code
  will remain.

*Sub-module: p5.Renderer*

---

## Variables

### contents

*   The print() function writes to the console area of
  your browser. This function is often helpful for
  looking at the data a program is producing. This
  function creates a new line of text for each call
  to the function. Individual elements can be
  separated with quotes ("") and joined with the
  addition operator (+). Note that calling print()
  without any arguments invokes the window.print()
  function which opens the browser's print dialog.
  To print a blank line to console you can write
  print('\n').
  - **contents**: any combination of Number, String,
  Object, Boolean, Array to print

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### deltaTime

*   The system variable deltaTime contains the time
  difference between the beginning of the previous
  frame and the beginning of the current frame in
  milliseconds. This variable is useful for creating
  time sensitive animation or physics calculation
  that should stay constant regardless of frame
  rate.

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### focused

*   Confirms if the window a p5.js program is in is
  "focused," meaning that the sketch will accept
  mouse or keyboard input. This variable is "true"
  if the window is focused and "false" if not.

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### version

*   If the sketch was created in WebGL mode, then
  weglVersion will indicate which version of WebGL
  it is using. It will try to create a WebGL2 canvas
  unless you have requested WebGL1 via
  setAttributes({ version: 1 }), and will fall back
  to WebGL1 if WebGL2 is not available. webglVersion
  will always be either WEBGL2, WEBGL, or P2D if not
  in WebGL mode.

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### displayWidth

*   System variable that stores the width of the
  screen display according to The default
  pixelDensity. This is used to run a full-screen
  program on any display size. To return actual
  screen size, multiply this by pixelDensity.

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### displayHeight

*   System variable that stores the height of the
  screen display according to The default
  pixelDensity. This is used to run a full-screen
  program on any display size. To return actual
  screen size, multiply this by pixelDensity.

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### windowWidth

*   System variable that stores the width of the inner
  window, it maps to window.innerWidth.

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### windowHeight

*   System variable that stores the height of the
  inner window, it maps to window.innerHeight.

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### width

*   System variable that stores the width of the
  drawing canvas. This value is set by the first
  parameter of the createCanvas() function. For
  example, the function call createCanvas(320, 240)
  sets the width variable to the value 320. The
  value of width defaults to 100 if createCanvas()
  is not used in a program.

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### height

*   System variable that stores the height of the
  drawing canvas. This value is set by the second
  parameter of the createCanvas() function. For
  example, the function call createCanvas(320, 240)
  sets the height variable to the value 240. The
  value of height defaults to 100 if createCanvas()
  is not used in a program.

*Sub-module: environment*

---

### note

*   Creates a canvas element in the document and sets
  its dimensions in pixels. This method should be
  called only once at the start of setup(). Calling
  createCanvas more than once in a sketch will
  result in very unpredictable behavior. If you want
  more than one drawing canvas you could use
  createGraphics() (hidden by default but it can be
  shown). Important note: in 2D mode (i.e. when
  p5.Renderer is not set) the origin (0,0) is
  positioned at the top left of the screen. In 3D
  mode (i.e. when p5.Renderer is set to WEBGL), the
  origin is positioned at the center of the canvas.
  See this issue for more information.
         *   A WebGL canvas will use a WebGL2 context if it is
  supported by the browser. Check the webglVersion
  property to check what version is being used, or
  call setAttributes({ version: 1 }) to create a
  WebGL1 context.
         *   The system variables width and height are set by
  the parameters passed to this function. If
  createCanvas() is not used, the window will be
  given a default size of 100×100 pixels.
         *   Optionally, an existing canvas can be passed using
  a selector, ie. document.getElementById(''). If
  specified, avoid using setAttributes() afterwards,
  as this will remove and recreate the existing
  canvas.
         *   For more ways to position the canvas, see the
  positioning the canvas wiki page.
  - **w**: width of the canvas
  - **h**: height of the canvas
