## 🔧 Functions

### 🔧 setMoveThreshold

*   The setMoveThreshold() function is used to set the
  movement threshold for the deviceMoved() function.
  The default threshold is set to 0.5.
  - **value**: The threshold value

📂 *Sub-module: acceleration*

---

### 🔧 setShakeThreshold

*   The setShakeThreshold() function is used to set
  the movement threshold for the deviceShaken()
  function. The default threshold is set to 30.
  - **value**: The threshold value

📂 *Sub-module: acceleration*

---

### 🔧 deviceMoved

*   The deviceMoved() function is called when the
  device is moved by more than the threshold value
  along X, Y or Z axis. The default threshold is set
  to 0.5. The threshold value can be changed using
  setMoveThreshold().

📂 *Sub-module: acceleration*

---

### 🔧 deviceTurned

*   The deviceTurned() function is called when the
  device rotates by more than 90 degrees
  continuously. The axis that triggers the
  deviceTurned() method is stored in the turnAxis
  variable. The deviceTurned() method can be locked
  to trigger on any axis: X, Y or Z by comparing the
  turnAxis variable to 'X', 'Y' or 'Z'.

📂 *Sub-module: acceleration*

---

### 🔧 deviceShaken

*   The deviceShaken() function is called when the
  device total acceleration changes of accelerationX
  and accelerationY values is more than the
  threshold value. The default threshold is set to
  30. The threshold value can be changed using
  setShakeThreshold().

📂 *Sub-module: acceleration*

---

### 🔧 keyPressed

*   The keyPressed() function is called once every
  time a key is pressed. The keyCode for the key
  that was pressed is stored in the keyCode
  variable. For non-ASCII keys, use the keyCode
  variable. You can check if the keyCode equals
  BACKSPACE, DELETE, ENTER, RETURN, TAB, ESCAPE,
  SHIFT, CONTROL, OPTION, ALT, UP_ARROW, DOWN_ARROW,
  LEFT_ARROW, RIGHT_ARROW.
         *   For ASCII keys, the key that was pressed is stored
  in the key variable. However, it does not
  distinguish between uppercase and lowercase. For
  this reason, it is recommended to use keyTyped()
  to read the key variable, in which the case of the
  variable will be distinguished.
         *   Because of how operating systems handle key
  repeats, holding down a key may cause multiple
  calls to keyTyped() (and keyReleased() as well).
  The rate of repeat is set by the operating system
  and how each computer is configured.
         *
  Browsers may have different default behaviors
  attached to various key events. To prevent any
  default behavior for this event, add "return
  false" to the end of the method.
  @param [event] optional KeyboardEvent callback
  argument.

📂 *Sub-module: keyboard*

### 🔧 keyReleased

*   The keyReleased() function is called once every
  time a key is released. See key and keyCode for
  more information. Browsers may have different
  default behaviors attached to various key events.
  To prevent any default behavior for this event,
  add "return false" to the end of the function.
  @param [event] optional KeyboardEvent callback
  argument.

📂 *Sub-module: keyboard*

---

### 🔧 keyTyped

*   The keyTyped() function is called once every time
  a key is pressed, but action keys such as
  Backspace, Delete, Ctrl, Shift, and Alt are
  ignored. If you are trying to detect a keyCode for
  one of these keys, use the keyPressed() function
  instead. The most recent key typed will be stored
  in the key variable. Because of how operating
  systems handle key repeats, holding down a key
  will cause multiple calls to keyTyped() (and
  keyReleased() as well). The rate of repeat is set
  by the operating system and how each computer is
  configured.
         *
  Browsers may have different default behaviors
  attached to various key events. To prevent any
  default behavior for this event, add "return
  false" to the end of the function.
  @param [event] optional KeyboardEvent callback
  argument.

📂 *Sub-module: keyboard*

---

### 🔧 keyIsDown

*   The keyIsDown() function checks if the key is
  currently down, i.e. pressed. It can be used if
  you have an object that moves, and you want
  several keys to be able to affect its behaviour
  simultaneously, such as moving a sprite
  diagonally. You can put in any number representing
  the keyCode of the key, or use any of the variable
  keyCode names listed here.
  - **code**: The key to check for.
  - **Returns**: whether key is down or not

📂 *Sub-module: keyboard*

### 🔧 mouseMoved

*   The mouseMoved() function is called every time the
  mouse moves and a mouse button is not pressed.
  Browsers may have different default behaviors
  attached to various mouse events. To prevent any
  default behavior for this event, add "return
  false" to the end of the method.
  @param [event] optional MouseEvent callback
  argument.

📂 *Sub-module: mouse*

---

### 🔧 mouseDragged

*   The mouseDragged() function is called once every
  time the mouse moves and a mouse button is
  pressed. If no mouseDragged() function is defined,
  the touchMoved() function will be called instead
  if it is defined. Browsers may have different
  default behaviors attached to various mouse
  events. To prevent any default behavior for this
  event, add "return false" to the end of the
  function.
  @param [event] optional MouseEvent callback
  argument.

📂 *Sub-module: mouse*

---

### 🔧 mousePressed

*   The mousePressed() function is called once after
  every time a mouse button is pressed. The
  mouseButton variable (see the related reference
  entry) can be used to determine which button has
  been pressed. If no mousePressed() function is
  defined, the touchStarted() function will be
  called instead if it is defined. Browsers may have
  different default behaviors attached to various
  mouse events. To prevent any default behavior for
  this event, add "return false" to the end of the
  function.
  @param [event] optional MouseEvent callback
  argument.

📂 *Sub-module: mouse*

---

### 🔧 mouseReleased

*   The mouseReleased() function is called every time
  a mouse button is released. If no mouseReleased()
  function is defined, the touchEnded() function
  will be called instead if it is defined. Browsers
  may have different default behaviors attached to
  various mouse events. To prevent any default
  behavior for this event, add "return false" to the
  end of the function.
  @param [event] optional MouseEvent callback
  argument.

📂 *Sub-module: mouse*

---

### 🔧 mouseClicked

*   The mouseClicked() function is called once after a
  mouse button has been pressed and then released.
  Browsers handle clicks differently, so this
  function is only guaranteed to be run when the
  left mouse button is clicked. To handle other
  mouse buttons being pressed or released, see
  mousePressed() or mouseReleased().
         *
  Browsers may have different default behaviors
  attached to various mouse events. To prevent any
  default behavior for this event, add "return
  false" to the end of the function.
  @param [event] optional MouseEvent callback
  argument.

📂 *Sub-module: mouse*

---

### 🔧 doubleClicked

*   The doubleClicked() function is executed every
  time a event listener has detected a dblclick
  event which is a part of the DOM L3 specification.
  The doubleClicked event is fired when a pointing
  device button (usually a mouse's primary button)
  is clicked twice on a single element. For more
  info on the dblclick event refer to mozilla's
  documentation here:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/dblclick
  @param [event] optional MouseEvent callback
  argument.

📂 *Sub-module: mouse*

---

### 🔧 mouseWheel

*   The function mouseWheel() is executed every time a
  vertical mouse wheel event is detected either
  triggered by an actual mouse wheel or by a
  touchpad. The event.delta property returns the
  amount the mouse wheel have scrolled. The values
  can be positive or negative depending on the
  scroll direction (on macOS with "natural"
  scrolling enabled, the signs are inverted).
         *
  Browsers may have different default behaviors
  attached to various mouse events. To prevent any
  default behavior for this event, add "return
  false" to the end of the method.
         *
  Due to the current support of the "wheel" event on
  Safari, the function may only work as expected if
  "return false" is included while using Safari.
  @param [event] optional WheelEvent callback
  argument.

📂 *Sub-module: mouse*

---

### 🔧 requestPointerLock

*   The function requestPointerLock() locks the
  pointer to its current position and makes it
  invisible. Use movedX and movedY to get the
  difference the mouse was moved since the last call
  of draw. Note that not all browsers support this
  feature. This enables you to create experiences
  that aren't limited by the mouse moving out of the
  screen even if it is repeatedly moved into one
  direction. For example, a first person perspective
  experience.

📂 *Sub-module: mouse*

---

### 🔧 exitPointerLock

*   The function exitPointerLock() exits a previously
  triggered pointer Lock for example to make ui
  elements usable etc

📂 *Sub-module: mouse*

---

### 🔧 touchStarted

*   The touchStarted() function is called once after
  every time a touch is registered. If no
  touchStarted() function is defined, the
  mousePressed() function will be called instead if
  it is defined. Browsers may have different default
  behaviors attached to various touch events. To
  prevent any default behavior for this event, add
  "return false" to the end of the method.
  @param [event] optional TouchEvent callback
  argument.

📂 *Sub-module: touch*

---

### 🔧 touchMoved

*   The touchMoved() function is called every time a
  touch move is registered. If no touchMoved()
  function is defined, the mouseDragged() function
  will be called instead if it is defined. Browsers
  may have different default behaviors attached to
  various touch events. To prevent any default
  behavior for this event, add "return false" to the
  end of the method.
  @param [event] optional TouchEvent callback
  argument.

📂 *Sub-module: touch*

---

### 🔧 touchEnded

*   The touchEnded() function is called every time a
  touch ends. If no touchEnded() function is
  defined, the mouseReleased() function will be
  called instead if it is defined. Browsers may have
  different default behaviors attached to various
  touch events. To prevent any default behavior for
  this event, add "return false" to the end of the
  method.
  @param [event] optional TouchEvent callback
  argument.
