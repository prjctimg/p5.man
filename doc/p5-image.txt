3. Functions                                           |p5-image-functions|

`Image()`                                          |p5-image-Image|

*   Creates a new p5.Image (the datatype for storing
  images). This provides a fresh buffer of pixels to
  play with. Set the size of the buffer with the
  width and height parameters. .pixels gives access
  to an array containing the values for all the
  pixels in the display window. These values are
  numbers. This array is the size (including an
  appropriate factor for the pixelDensity) of the
  display window x4, representing the R, G, B, A
  values in order for each pixel, moving from left
  to right across each row, then down each column.
  See .pixels for more info. It may also be simpler
  to use set() or get().
         *   Before accessing the pixels of an image, the data
  must loaded with the loadPixels() function. After
  the array data has been modified, the
  updatePixels() function must be run to update the
  changes.
  - **width**: width in pixels
  - **height**: height in pixels
  - **Returns**: the p5.Image object

`canvas()`                                          |p5-image-canvas|

*   Save the current canvas as an image. The browser
  will either save the file immediately, or prompt
  the user with a dialogue window.
  - **selectedCanvas**: a variable representing a
  specific html5 canvas (optional)
  @param [extension] 'jpg' or 'png'

`loadImage()`                                          |p5-image-loadImage|

*   Loads an image from a path and creates a p5.Image
  from it. The image may not be immediately
  available for rendering. If you want to ensure
  that the image is ready before doing anything with
  it, place the loadImage() call in preload(). You
  may also supply a callback function to handle the
  image when it's ready.
         *   The path to the image should be relative to the
  HTML file that links in your sketch. Loading an
  image from a URL or other remote location may be
  blocked due to your browser's built-in security.
         *   You can also pass in a string of a base64 encoded
  image as an alternative to the file path. Remember
  to add "data:image/png;base64," in front of the
  string.
  - **path**: Path of the image to be loaded
  @param [successCallback] Function to be called
  once the image is loaded. Will be passed the
  p5.Image.
  @param [failureCallback] called with event error
  if the image fails to load.
  - **Returns**: the p5.Image object

`where()`                                          |p5-image-where|

*   Draw an image to the p5.js canvas. This function
  can be used with different numbers of parameters.
  The simplest use requires only three parameters:
  img, x, and y—where (x, y) is the position of the
  image. Two more parameters can optionally be added
  to specify the width and height of the image.
         *   This function can also be used with eight Number
  parameters. To differentiate between all these
  parameters, p5.js uses the language of
  "destination rectangle" (which corresponds to
  "dx", "dy", etc.) and "source image" (which
  corresponds to "sx", "sy", etc.) below. Specifying
  the "source image" dimensions can be useful when
  you want to display a subsection of the source
  image instead of the whole thing. Here's a diagram
  to explain further:
         *   This function can also be used to draw images
  without distorting the orginal aspect ratio, by
  adding 9th parameter, fit, which can either be
  COVER or CONTAIN. CONTAIN, as the name suggests,
  contains the whole image within the specified
  destination box without distorting the image
  ratio. COVER covers the entire destination box.
  - **img**: the image to display
  - **x**: the x-coordinate of the top-left corner
  of the image
  - **y**: the y-coordinate of the top-left corner
  of the image
  @param [width] the width to draw the image
  @param [height] the height to draw the image

`tint()`                                          |p5-image-tint|

*   Sets the fill value for displaying images. Images
  can be tinted to specified colors or made
  transparent by including an alpha value. To apply
  transparency to an image without affecting its
  color, use white as the tint color and specify an
  alpha value. For instance, tint(255, 128) will
  make an image 50% transparent (assuming the
  default alpha range of 0-255, which can be changed
  with colorMode()).
         *   The value for the gray parameter must be less than
  or equal to the current maximum value as specified
  by colorMode(). The default maximum value is 255.
  - **v1**: red or hue value relative to the current
  color range

`image()`                                          |p5-image-image|

*   Set image mode. Modifies the location from which
  images are drawn by changing the way in which
  parameters given to image() are interpreted. The
  default mode is imageMode(CORNER), which
  interprets the second and third parameters of
  image() as the upper-left corner of the image. If
  two additional parameters are specified, they are
  used to set the image's width and height.
  imageMode(CORNERS) interprets the second and third
  parameters of image() as the location of one
  corner, and the fourth and fifth parameters as the
  opposite corner.
         *   imageMode(CENTER) interprets the second and third
  parameters of image() as the image's center point.
  If two additional parameters are specified, they
  are used to set the image's width and height.

`0()`                                          |p5-image-0|

*   Applies a filter to the canvas. The presets
  options are: THRESHOLD Converts the image to black
  and white pixels depending if they are above or
  below the threshold defined by the level
  parameter. The parameter must be between 0.0
  (black) and 1.0 (white). If no level is specified,
  0.5 is used.
         *   GRAY Converts any colors in the image to grayscale
  equivalents. No parameter is used.
         *   OPAQUE Sets the alpha channel to entirely opaque.
  No parameter is used.
         *   INVERT Sets each pixel to its inverse value. No
  parameter is used.
         *   POSTERIZE Limits each channel of the image to the
  number of colors specified as the parameter. The
  parameter can be set to values between 2 and 255,
  but results are most noticeable in the lower
  ranges.
         *   BLUR Executes a Gaussian blur with the level
  parameter specifying the extent of the blurring.
  If no parameter is used, the blur is equivalent to
  Gaussian blur of radius 1. Larger values increase
  the blur.
         *   ERODE Reduces the light areas. No parameter is
  used.
         *   DILATE Increases the light areas. No parameter is
  used.
         *   filter() does not work in WEBGL mode. A similar
  effect can be achieved in WEBGL mode using custom
  shaders. Adam Ferriss has written a selection of
  shader examples that contains many of the effects
  present in the filter examples.
  - **filterType**: either THRESHOLD, GRAY, OPAQUE,
  INVERT, POSTERIZE, BLUR, ERODE, DILATE or BLUR.
  See Filters.js for docs on each available filter
  @param [filterParam] an optional parameter unique
  to each filter, see above

`imageMode()`                                          |p5-image-imageMode|

*   Get a region of pixels, or a single pixel, from
  the canvas. Returns an array of [R,G,B,A] values
  for any pixel or grabs a section of an image. If
  no parameters are specified, the entire image is
  returned. Use the x and y parameters to get the
  value of one pixel. Get a section of the display
  window by specifying additional w and h
  parameters. When getting an image, the x and y
  parameters define the coordinates for the
  upper-left corner of the image, regardless of the
  current imageMode().
         *   Getting the color of a single pixel with get(x, y)
  is easy, but not as fast as grabbing the data
  directly from pixels[]. The equivalent statement
  to get(x, y) using pixels[] with pixel density d
  is
         *   let x, y, d; // set these to the coordinates let
  off = (y * width + x) * d * 4; let components = [
  pixels[off], pixels[off + 1], pixels[off + 2],
  pixels[off + 3] ]; print(components);
         *   See the reference for pixels[] for more
  information.
         *   If you want to extract an array of colors or a
  subimage from an p5.Image object, take a look at
  p5.Image.get()
  - **x**: x-coordinate of the pixel
  - **y**: y-coordinate of the pixel
  - **w**: width of the section to be returned
  - **h**: height of the section to be returned
  - **Returns**: the rectangle p5.Image

`imageMode()`                                          |p5-image-imageMode|

*   Get a region of pixels, or a single pixel, from
  the canvas. Returns an array of [R,G,B,A] values
  for any pixel or grabs a section of an image. If
  no parameters are specified, the entire image is
  returned. Use the x and y parameters to get the
  value of one pixel. Get a section of the display
  window by specifying additional w and h
  parameters. When getting an image, the x and y
  parameters define the coordinates for the
  upper-left corner of the image, regardless of the
  current imageMode().
         *   Getting the color of a single pixel with get(x, y)
  is easy, but not as fast as grabbing the data
  directly from pixels[]. The equivalent statement
  to get(x, y) using pixels[] with pixel density d
  is
         *   let x, y, d; // set these to the coordinates let
  off = (y * width + x) * d * 4; let components = [
  pixels[off], pixels[off + 1], pixels[off + 2],
  pixels[off + 3] ]; print(components);
         *   See the reference for pixels[] for more
  information.
         *   If you want to extract an array of colors or a
  subimage from an p5.Image object, take a look at
  p5.Image.get()
  - **x**: x-coordinate of the pixel
  - **y**: y-coordinate of the pixel
  - **Returns**: color of pixel at x,y in array format [R,
  G, B, A]

`set()`                                          |p5-image-set|

*   Loads the pixel data for the display window into
  the pixels[] array. This function must always be
  called before reading from or writing to pixels[].
  Note that only changes made with set() or direct
  manipulation of pixels[] will occur.

`imageMode()`                                          |p5-image-imageMode|

*   Changes the color of any pixel, or writes an image
  directly to the display window. The x and y
  parameters specify the pixel to change and the c
  parameter specifies the color value. This can be a
  p5.Color object, or [R, G, B, A] pixel array. It
  can also be a single grayscale value. When setting
  an image, the x and y parameters define the
  coordinates for the upper-left corner of the
  image, regardless of the current imageMode().
  After using set(), you must call updatePixels()
  for your changes to appear. This should be called
  once all pixels have been set, and must be called
  before calling .get() or drawing the image.
         *   Setting the color of a single pixel with set(x, y)
  is easy, but not as fast as putting the data
  directly into pixels[]. Setting the pixels[]
  values directly may be complicated when working
  with a retina display, but will perform better
  when lots of pixels need to be set directly on
  every loop. See the reference for pixels[] for
  more information.
  - **x**: x-coordinate of the pixel
  - **y**: y-coordinate of the pixel
  - **c**: insert a grayscale value | a pixel array

`loadPixels()`                                          |p5-image-loadPixels|

*   Updates the display window with the data in the
  pixels[] array. Use in conjunction with
  loadPixels(). If you're only reading pixels from
  the array, there's no need to call updatePixels()
  — updating is only necessary to apply changes.
  updatePixels() should be called anytime the pixels
  array is manipulated or set() is called, and only
  changes made with set() or direct changes to
  pixels[] will occur.

  of region to update

`loadImage()`                                          |p5-image-loadImage|

*   Creates a new p5.Image. A p5.Image is a canvas
  backed representation of an image. p5 can display
  .gif, .jpg and .png images. Images may be
  displayed in 2D and 3D space. Before an image is
  used, it must be loaded with the loadImage()
  function. The p5.Image class contains fields for
  the width and height of the image, as well as an
  array called pixels[] that contains the values for
  every pixel in the image.
         *   The methods described below allow easy access to
  the image's pixels and alpha channel and simplify
  the process of compositing.
         *   Before using the pixels[] array, be sure to use
  the loadPixels() method on the image to make sure
  that the pixel data is properly loaded.

`0()`                                          |p5-image-0|

*   Applies an image filter to a p5.Image THRESHOLD
  Converts the image to black and white pixels
  depending if they are above or below the threshold
  defined by the level parameter. The parameter must
  be between 0.0 (black) and 1.0 (white). If no
  level is specified, 0.5 is used.

  No parameter is used.
         *   INVERT Sets each pixel to its inverse value. No
  parameter is used.
         *   POSTERIZE Limits each channel of the image to the
  number of colors specified as the parameter. The
  parameter can be set to values between 2 and 255,
  but results are most noticeable in the lower
  ranges.
         *   BLUR Executes a Gaussian blur with the level
  parameter specifying the extent of the blurring.
  If no parameter is used, the blur is equivalent to
  Gaussian blur of radius 1. Larger values increase

`pixels`                                          |p5-image-pixels|

*   Array containing the values for all the pixels in
  the display window. These values are numbers. This
  array is the size (include an appropriate factor
  for pixelDensity) of the display window x4,
  representing the R, G, B, A values in order for
  each pixel, moving from left to right across each
  row, then down each column. Retina and other high
  density displays may have more pixels (by a factor
  of pixelDensity^2). For example, if the image is
  100×100 pixels, there will be 40,000. With
  pixelDensity = 2, there will be 160,000. The first
  four values (indices 0-3) in the array will be the
  R, G, B, A values of the pixel at (0, 0). The
  second four values (indices 4-7) will contain the
  R, G, B, A values of the pixel at (1, 0). More
  generally, to set values for a pixel at (x, y):
  let d = pixelDensity(); for (let i = 0; i < d;
  i++) { for (let j = 0; j < d; j++) { // loop over
  index = 4 * ((y * d + j) * width * d + (x * d +
  i)); pixels[index] = r; pixels[index+1] = g;
  pixels[index+2] = b; pixels[index+3] = a; } }
         *   Before accessing this array, the data must loaded
  with the loadPixels() function. After the array
  data has been modified, the updatePixels()
  function must be run to update the changes.
