  amount to interpolate between the two values where
  0.0 is equal to the first point, 0.1 is very near
  the first point, 0.5 is half-way in between, and
  1.0 is equal to the second point. If the value of
  amt is more than 1.0 or less than 0.0, the number
  will be calculated accordingly in the ratio of the
  two given numbers. The lerp() function is
  convenient for creating motion along a straight
  path and for drawing dotted lines.

*   Calculates the magnitude (or length) of a vector.
  A vector is a direction in space commonly used in
  computer graphics and linear algebra. Because it
  has no "start" position, the magnitude of a vector
  can be thought of as the distance from the
  coordinate 0,0 to its x,y value. Therefore, mag()
  is a shortcut for writing dist(0, 0, x, y).
  - **a**: first value
  - **b**: second value
  - **Returns**: magnitude of vector from (0,0) to (a,b)

*   Re-maps a number from one range to another. In the
  first example above, the number 25 is converted
  from a value in the range of 0 to 100 into a value
  that ranges from the left edge of the window (0)
  to the right edge (width).
  - **value**: the incoming value to be converted
  - **start1**: lower bound of the value's current
  range

`map()`                                          |p5-math-map|

*   Normalizes a number from another range into a
  value between 0 and 1. Identical to map(value,
  low, high, 0, 1). Numbers outside of the range are
  not clamped to 0 and 1, because out-of-range
  values are often intentional and useful. (See the
  example above.)
  - **value**: incoming value to be normalized
  - **start**: lower bound of the value's current
  range
  - **stop**: upper bound of the value's current
  range
  - **Returns**: normalized number

`pow()`                                          |p5-math-pow|

*   Facilitates exponential expressions. The pow()
  function is an efficient way of multiplying
  numbers by themselves (or their reciprocals) in
  large quantities. For example, pow(3, 5) is
  equivalent to the expression 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 and
  pow(3, -5) is equivalent to 1 / 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3.

  The result is always a positive number, as
  multiplying two negative numbers always yields a
  positive result. For example, -1 * -1 = 1.

`Vector()`                                          |p5-math-Vector|

*   Creates a new p5.Vector (the datatype for storing
  vectors). This provides a two or three-dimensional
  vector, specifically a Euclidean (also known as
  geometric) vector. A vector is an entity that has
  both magnitude and direction.
  @param [x] x component of the vector

`random()`                                          |p5-math-random|

*   Returns the Perlin noise value at specified
  coordinates. Perlin noise is a random sequence
  generator producing a more naturally ordered,
  harmonic succession of numbers compared to the
  standard random() function. It was invented by Ken
  Perlin in the 1980s and been used since in
  graphical applications to produce procedural
  textures, natural motion, shapes, terrains etc.
  The main difference to the random() function is
  that Perlin noise is defined in an infinite
  n-dimensional space where each pair of coordinates
  corresponds to a fixed semi-random value (fixed
  only for the lifespan of the program; see the
  noiseSeed() function). p5.js can compute 1D, 2D
  and 3D noise, depending on the number of
  coordinates given. The resulting value will always
  be between 0.0 and 1.0. The noise value can be
  animated by moving through the noise space as
  demonstrated in the example above. The 2nd and 3rd
  dimensions can also be interpreted as time.
         *   The actual noise is structured similar to an audio
  signal, in respect to the function's use of
  frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics
  in physics, Perlin noise is computed over several
  octaves which are added together for the final
  result.
         *   Another way to adjust the character of the
  resulting sequence is the scale of the input
  coordinates. As the function works within an
  infinite space the value of the coordinates
  doesn't matter as such, only the distance between
  successive coordinates does (eg. when using
  noise() within a loop). As a general rule the
  smaller the difference between coordinates, the
  smoother the resulting noise sequence will be.
  Steps of 0.005-0.03 work best for most
  applications, but this will differ depending on
  use.
  - **x**: x-coordinate in noise space
  @param [y] y-coordinate in noise space
  @param [z] z-coordinate in noise space
  - **Returns**: Perlin noise value (between 0 and 1) at
  specified coordinates

`impact()`                                          |p5-math-impact|

*   Adjusts the character and level of detail produced
  by the Perlin noise function. Similar to harmonics
  in physics, noise is computed over several
  octaves. Lower octaves contribute more to the
  output signal and as such define the overall
  intensity of the noise, whereas higher octaves
  create finer-grained details in the noise
  sequence. By default, noise is computed over 4
  octaves with each octave contributing exactly half
  as much as its predecessor, starting at 50%
  strength for the 1st octave. This falloff amount
  can be changed by adding an additional function
  parameter. Eg. a falloff factor of 0.75 means each
  octave will now have 75% impact (25% less) of the
  previous lower octave. Any value between 0.0 and
  1.0 is valid, however, note that values greater
  than 0.5 might result in greater than 1.0 values
  returned by noise(). By changing these parameters,
  the signal created by the noise() function can be
  adapted to fit very specific needs and
  characteristics.
  - **lod**: number of octaves to be used by the
  noise
  - **falloff**: falloff factor for each octave

`randomGaussian()`                                          |p5-math-randomGaussian|

*   Returns a random number fitting a Gaussian, or
  normal, distribution. There is theoretically no
  minimum or maximum value that randomGaussian()
  might return. Rather, there is just a very low
  probability that values far from the mean will be
  returned; and a higher probability that numbers
  near the mean will be returned. Takes either 0, 1
  or 2 arguments. If no args, the mean is 0 and the
  standard deviation is 1.
         *   If one arg, that arg is the mean and the standard

`Euclidean()`                                          |p5-math-Euclidean|

*   A class to describe a two or three-dimensional
  vector, specifically a Euclidean (also known as
  geometric) vector. A vector is an entity that has
  both magnitude and direction. The datatype,
  however, stores the components of the vector (x, y
  for 2D; or x, y, z for 3D). The magnitude and
  direction can be accessed via the methods
  p5.Vector.mag() and heading(). In many of the
  p5.js examples, you will see p5.Vector used to
  describe a position, velocity, or acceleration.
  For example, if you consider a rectangle moving
  across the screen, at any given instant it has a
  position (a vector that points from the origin to
  its location), a velocity (the rate at which the
  object's position changes per time unit, expressed
  as a vector), and acceleration (the rate at which
  the object's velocity changes per time unit,
  expressed as a vector).
         *   Since vectors represent groupings of values, we
  cannot simply use traditional
  addition/multiplication/etc. Instead, we'll need
  to do some "vector" math, which is made easy by
  the methods inside the p5.Vector class.

`v`                                          |p5-math-v|

*   A class to describe a two or three-dimensional
  vector, specifically a Euclidean (also known as
  geometric) vector. A vector is an entity that has
  both magnitude and direction. The datatype,
  however, stores the components of the vector (x, y
  for 2D; or x, y, z for 3D). The magnitude and
  direction can be accessed via the methods
  p5.Vector.mag() and heading(). In many of the
  p5.js examples, you will see p5.Vector used to
  describe a position, velocity, or acceleration.
  For example, if you consider a rectangle moving
  across the screen, at any given instant it has a
  position (a vector that points from the origin to
  its location), a velocity (the rate at which the
  object's position changes per time unit, expressed
  as a vector), and acceleration (the rate at which
  the object's velocity changes per time unit,
  expressed as a vector).
         *   Since vectors represent groupings of values, we
  cannot simply use traditional
  addition/multiplication/etc. Instead, we'll need
  to do some "vector" math, which is made easy by
  the methods inside the p5.Vector class.
         *   @param [x] x component of the vector
  @param [y] y component of the vector
  @param [z] z component of the vector
